### API INTEGRATION CONTEXT

#### EXISTING SERVICES TO USE
```javascript
// Available Services (DO NOT RECREATE)
- authService: User authentication & session management
- quizService: Quiz data fetching & submission
- userService: User profile management
- analyticsService: Performance data retrieval

// Existing Stores (EXTEND, DON'T REPLACE)

- Authentication guard
- Role-based access control
```

#### DATA FLOW PATTERNS
```javascript
// Standard Data Flow (FOLLOW THIS PATTERN)
1. Component mounts ‚Üí Check auth state
2. Fetch data via service layer ‚Üí Update store
3. Reactive UI updates ‚Üí Display loading/error states
4. User interactions ‚Üí Dispatch store actions
5. Store updates ‚Üí Trigger reactive UI changes

// Error Handling Pattern
try {
  const data = await quizService.fetchQuizzes()
  store.setQuizzes(data)
} catch (error) {
  store.setError(error.message)
  // Show user-friendly error message
}
```

  <div class="component-container">
    <!-- Loading state -->
    <LoadingSpinner v-if="loading" />
    
    <!-- Error state -->
    <ErrorMessage v-else-if="error" :message="error" />
    
    <!-- Main content -->
    <div v-else class="main-content">
      <!-- Component-specific UI -->

<script setup>
// Standard imports
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'

// Store imports
import { useUserStore } from '@/stores/user'
import { useQuizStore } from '@/stores/quiz'

// Service imports
import { quizService } from '@/services/quizService'

// Component logic following established patterns
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Component-specific styles using TailwindCSS */
</style>
```

### INTEGRATION PATTERNS
```javascript
// Standard Store Usage Pattern
const userStore = useUserStore()
const quizStore = useQuizStore()

// Data Fetching Pattern
const loading = ref(false)
const error = ref(null)

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    loading.value = true
    const data = await service.getData()
    store.setData(data)
  } catch (err) {
    error.value = err.message
  } finally {
    loading.value = false
  }
}

// Reactive Computed Pattern
const filteredData = computed(() => {
  return store.data.filter(item => 
    // Apply user preferences and filters
  )
})
