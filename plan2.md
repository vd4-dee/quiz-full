- Best performing category (Excel/Python/Pandas with highest avg)
- Worst performing category (lowest average for improvement focus)
- Score improvement trend (first 5 vs last 5 quizzes)
- Accuracy rate by difficulty level (easy/normal/hard/very hard)

TIME-BASED ANALYTICS:
- Total study time (sum of all quiz durations)
- Average time per quiz (total time / quiz count)
- Most active study hours (time pattern analysis)
- Study frequency (quizzes per day/week/month)
- Fastest quiz completion times
- Time efficiency score (high score in less time)

CATEGORY DEEP DIVE:

  // Calculate performance by Excel/Python/Pandas categories
}

async getTimeAnalytics(userId) {
  // Calculate time-based study patterns
}

async getProgressionData(userId) {
  // Get chronological performance data for trends
}

async getComparativeData(userId) {

GOAL: Implement optimized data fetching and caching for statistics pages

CREATE: services/statisticsDataManager.js

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

DATA CACHING SYSTEM:
```javascript
class StatisticsDataManager {
  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Map()
    this.subscriptions = new Map()
    this.refreshIntervals = new Map()
  }
  
  // Intelligent caching with TTL
  async getUserStats(userId, forceRefresh = false) {
    const cacheKey = `user_stats_${userId}`
    
    if (!forceRefresh && this.isCacheValid(cacheKey)) {
      return this.cache.get(cacheKey).data
    }
    
    const stats = await this.calculateUserStatistics(userId)
    this.setCache(cacheKey, stats, 300) // 5-minute TTL
    return stats
  }
  
  // Real-time updates with smart batching
  subscribeToUserDataChanges(userId, callback) {
    const subscription = pb.collection('submissions').subscribe('*', (e) => {
      if (e.record.user === userId) {
        this.invalidateUserCache(userId)
        this.debouncedRefresh(userId, callback)
      }

      const [stats, rankings, profile] = await Promise.all([
        this.calculatePersonalStats(userId),
        this.getUserRankingData(userId),
        this.getUserProfileData(userId)
      ])
      
      // Update all data atomically
      this.userStats = stats
      this.leaderboardData = rankings
      this.profileData = profile
      this.lastUpdated = new Date()
